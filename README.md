Employee On-boarding Tracking System

	Our process improver app will track and save the time of the company about new employee joining processes. 
In general, new employee joining process involves following tasks,
1.	Company has to create new employee access card/ identification card.
2.	Computer, phone extension, cabin/ desk assignment etc assignment for the new employee.
3.	Create a new access for the new project repository and software which company uses.
4.	Generate new access and authorizations for the machines like computer, printer, scanner, etc.
5.	Create a new email/ chat application access.
6.	Make project setup for new employee.
To complete above all tasks, normally it takes one week, in some companies more than that. 
So, Our proposed app—“Employee On-boarding Tracking System” will automate and track these processes on its own by a single click before joining of new employee to company. This app will send individual emails to each and every department related to new employee joining process. 
	Firstly when the new employee will join under particular manager then he will create a new activity before two weeks of new employee joining date. He will provide his details and will click on initiate process button which will automatically sends an email/ messages to the respective departments related to the process of new joiner. So, the email and messages on this app will be seen by all related departments and they can start working on the process as soon as possible. After their completion of task they can update the progress and details in this application. As every department is updating his work done, this app will track the progress and shows how much the process is done with report. Also, this app will notify the percentage work done, progress of individual department.
